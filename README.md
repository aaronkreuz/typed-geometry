# typed-math

Header-only strongly typed math library for graphics.


## Usage / Example


```
#include <tm/typed-math.hh>

tg::vec3 v;

// TODO
```


## Namespace `tg`

Why not `tm::vec3`?

* `struct tm` in `time.h` conflicts with this namespace
* `tgm` is too long
* This library closely works with `typed-graphics` anyways
* May be thought of as `typed-geometry`


## Dependencies

None.

## TODO

* Benchmark how compile times are affected by includes
